Privileged Escalation Detection

Overview
This project uses machine learning algorithms to detect privileged escalation attacks. The project includes three models: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network.

Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- NumPy

Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone (link unavailable)
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download the dataset: `wget (link unavailable)

Usage
1. Preprocess the data: `python (link unavailable)`
2. Train the models: `python (link unavailable)`
3. Evaluate the models: `python (link unavailable)`
4. Use the models for prediction: `python (link unavailable)`

Models
- Random Forest: `(link unavailable)`
- Support Vector Machine (SVM): `(link unavailable)`
- Neural Network: `(link unavailable)`

Dataset
- The dataset used for this project is a CSV file containing features and labels.
- The features include system logs and network traffic data.
- The labels indicate whether the data corresponds to a privileged escalation attack or not.
